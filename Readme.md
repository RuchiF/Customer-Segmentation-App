# Customer Segmentation App

## Project Overview

In this project, we dive into the world of customer behavior by classifying them based on their buying habits using K-Means Clustering. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns in how people shop, which can be a game-changer for businesses. With these insights, companies can better understand their customers, craft personalized marketing strategies, and optimize their approach to make every interaction more meaningful.

## Approach 

I have used Online Retail Dataset available of Kaggle for this project 

1. **Data Collection**: Users can enter user data to check which segment user falls in.
2. **Preprocessing**: The app cleans and preprocesses the data , scales the data as per the requirement of the model.
3. **Segmentation**: Clustering Algorithms such as K- means is used for this purpose.
4. **Visualization**: Interactive visualizations display the results, highlighting the characteristics of each customer segment.
5. **Insights**: Insights related to this project are highlighted in the notebook.
